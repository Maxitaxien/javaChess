	Queen
	King
inf101.chess.rules (optional if not easily implementable in inf101.sem2.game)
	CheckRule
	StalemateRule
	CheckmateRule
inf101.grid
	ChessMove (extends move)
	Otherwise - use some existing classes
inf101.sem2
	ChessGUI
inf101.sem2.game
	ChessBoard (inspired by GameBoard)
	ChessGraphics (inspired by Graphics)
	ChessMoveGame (inspired by multimovegame)
	Otherwise use existing classes
	GameState (enum to track if stalemate, check, checkmate etc.)
inf101.sem2.game.games
	Chess (main game file)
inf101.sem2.GUI
	ChessGamePanel (adapted from GamePanel)
