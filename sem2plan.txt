Chess structure:

inf101.chess.pieces
	Piece (ABC)
	Pawn
	Bishop
	Knight
	Rook
	Queen
	King
inf101.grid
	ChessMove (extends move)
	Otherwise same as before
inf101.sem2
	Same as before
inf101.sem2.game
	ChessGraphics
	Maybe some changes to multimovegame/new class that extends it
	Otherwise same as before
inf101.sem2.game.games
	add Chess.java
inf101.sem2.GUI
	add instructions/rules button

Can't see the need for more classes in the other packages as of yet
